           <p>On 31 December 2019, WHO was informed of cases of pneumonia 
               of unknown cause in Wuhan City, China. A novel coronavirus 
               was identified as the cause by Chinese authorities on 7 
               January 2020 and was temporarily named “2019-nCoV”.</p>

        <h2>What is Coronavirus</h2>
        <p>
            Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause
             illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. <br>
              A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been 
              previously identified in humans.
             The new virus was subsequently named the “COVID-19 virus”.
