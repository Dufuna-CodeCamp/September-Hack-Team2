            <h2>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic</h2>

            <p>On 31 December 2019, WHO was informed of cases
                of pneumonia
                of unknown cause in Wuhan City, China. <br> A novel coronavirus
                was identified as the cause by Chinese authorities on 7
                January 2020 and was temporarily named “2019-nCoV”.</p>

            <h2>What is Coronavirus</h2>
            <p>
                Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause
                illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. <br>
                A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been
                previously identified in humans.
                The new virus was subsequently named the “COVID-19 virus”.
            </p>

            <p>
                On 11 March 2020, the rapid increase in the number
                of cases outside China led the WHO Director-General
                to announce that the outbreak could be <br> characterized
                as a pandemic. By then more than 118 000 cases had been
                reported in
                114 countries, and 4291 deaths had been recorded.
            </p>

            <p>
                By mid-March 2020, the WHO European Region had become the epicentre <br>
                of the epidemic, reporting over 40% of globally confirmed cases. As of 28 April 2020, <br>
                63% of global mortality from the virus was from the Region.
                Since the first cases were reported, WHO has worked around the clock to support countries to <br>
                prepare and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the words of Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional
                Director for Europe, “Through transparent knowledge-sharing, tailored support on the ground, and
                steadfast solidarity, we will beat COVID-19.”
