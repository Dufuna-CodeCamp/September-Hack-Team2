            <h3>Basics of COVID-19</h3>
            <p>
                COVID-19 is a dangerous disease caused by a virus discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It is very contagious and has quickly spread around the world.<br>
                COVID-19 most often causes respiratory symptoms that can feel much like a cold, a flu, or pneumonia, but COVID-19 can also harm other parts of the body.<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most people who catch COVID-19 have mild symptoms, but some people become severely ill.</li>
                        <li>Older adults and people who have certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.</li>
                        <li>Hundreds of thousands of people have died from COVID-19 in the United States.</li>
                        <li>Vaccines against COVID-19 are safe and effective.</li>
                    </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>About the name</h3>
            <p>
                On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease: coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated COVID-19. ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. 
                The virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is a coronavirus. 
                The word corona means crown and refers to the appearance that coronaviruses get from the spike proteins sticking out of them.
            </p>
            <h3>Other coronaviruses</h3>
            <p>
                Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can infect people and many animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. 
                There are many types of coronaviruses, including some that give people a common head or chest cold. 
                Other coronavirus diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are extremely dangerous but are much less widespread than colds and COVID-19.

            <h3>How does the Virus spread?</h3>
            <p>
                COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus. 
                These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth. In some circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces they touch. 
                People who are closer than 6 feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected.
                COVID-19 is spread in three main ways:
                <ul>
                    <li>Breathing in air when close to an infected person who is exhaling small droplets and particles that contain the virus.</li>
                    <li>Having these small droplets and particles that contain virus land on the eyes, nose, or mouth, especially through splashes and sprays like a cough or sneeze.</li>
                    <li>Touching eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have the virus on them.</li>
                </ul>               
            </p>
            <h3>Symptoms of COVID-19</h3>
            <p>
                People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. 
                Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fever or chills</li>
                    <li>Cough</li>
                    <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
                    <li>Fatigue</li>
                    <li>Muscle or body aches</li>
                    <li>Headache</li>
                    <li>New loss of taste or smell</li>
                    <li>Sore throat</li>
                    <li>Congestion or runny nose</li>
                    <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
                    <li>Diarrhea</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The graph above shows the frequency of the most common symptoms of COVID-19 among many people</p>
                This list does not include all possible symptoms. 
                CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19. 
                Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.
